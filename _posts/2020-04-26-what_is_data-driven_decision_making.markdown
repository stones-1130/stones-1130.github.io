One of the reasons I am studying data science is to get a better understanding of the nauseatingly over-used corporate buzz-phrase “Data-Driven Decision Making.”  A quick Google search reveals numerous articles from business schools and SaaS companies advertising business intelligence tools to help companies make better data-driven decisions. It appears there is even a formal acronym, “DDDM,” that I will unashamedly use for the remainder of this blog post. 

My initial research suggests that successfully implementing a DDDM strategy is harder than it looks, and not necessarily from a technical standpoint. I’ve also started to think about the role of a data scientist in a company that decides to leverage DDDM. 

When I began hearing about DDDM a couple years ago, I assumed it simply referred to using spreadsheets and data instead of emotions or gut instinct to make business decisions- i.e. a practice that has been around since numbers and accounting were invented.  As it turns out, my initial assumption was pretty accurate, albeit grossly oversimplified. 

According to the [datapine blog](https://www.datapine.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-in-businesses), “DDDM is a process that involves collecting data based on measurable goals or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), analyzing patterns and facts from these insights, and utilizing them to develop strategies and activities that benefit the business in a number of areas.”

What struck me most about the discrepancy between my initial impression of DDDM and datapine’s definition was the discovery that there was a process behind DDDM that had nothing to do with analyzing data itself- specifically, “establishing measurable goals or KPIs.”

To me, this means that a company could hire the best data scientists in the world but if corporate hasn’t figured out what they want to measure (data to collect/analyze) or where they want to go (company vision) the net positive effect of analysis or projections will be minimal. 

There’s evidence to suggest that even after committing to a DDDM strategy, many companies still make decisions based on other factors and choose to ignore the data. [Bernard Farr from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/#2830c84380f9) points out a specific example he calls the HiPPO effect, referring to the “highest paid person’s opinion” as frequently steering corporate decision making over evidence-based analysis.

So- what is the data scientist's role in "establishing measurable goals and KPIs?" For starters, I think a good data scientist should be able to ask his bosses hard questions before opening the first jupyter notebook:

1.	What are we trying to measure and why?
2.	What will the company do differently after seeing analysis or projections? 
3.	Is the problem we are trying to solve actually a data problem? 

I will refine this list and add questions as I continue my studies at Flatiron School.
