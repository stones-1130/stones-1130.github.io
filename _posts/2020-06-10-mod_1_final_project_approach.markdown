Completing the MOD 1 project taught me the importance of thinking about the questions you want to answer before you open your first Jupyter Notebook. 

As I mentioned in my first blog post, doing data analysis without a clear hypothesis or understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve is a recipe for wasted time and frustrated customers. 

In this project, it was very helpful to think big to small. All we were told was that Microsoft wanted to enter the movie business, and they requested our help to figure out where they should start and what type of movie they should make. 

Seeing as I wasn’t in “the room” when the decision was made to pursue cinema as a business line for a software company, I thought it was important to educate my fictional non-technical audience on some of the macro-level financial data points to give them a sense of scale before diving into specifics and film recommendations.

**Macro-level Questions:**

1. What are the highest grossing movies of all time, and how much did they make? 
2. What are the highest grossing movies from the last ten years (2010-2020)? 
3. Did films make more money in the U.S. or in foreign markets?
4. What percentage of movies are successful?
5. What's the average return on investment for a successful film?
6. What's the average production budget for the top 150 most successful (by worldwide gross) movies of the last ten years?

Once the stage was set at the macro level, I drilled down further into the data, in order to recommend a way-forward.

**Micro Questions:**

1. Which movies had the highest return on investment from the last 10 years (2010-2020)? 
2. Which production companies were the most successful during the past 10 years?
3. Which production company had the highest ROI?
4. What parental guidance ratings were associated with the highest earnings?

Once the stage was set at the macro level, I drilled down further into the data, in order to recommend a way-forward. 

For me, the interesting conversations supported by data are less about trying to figure out what movie to make- they’re about asking whether or not it’s a good idea to start making movies in the first place.
